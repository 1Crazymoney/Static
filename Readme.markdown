Simple static table views for iOS in Swift.


## Building

Static is written in Swift 2 so Xcode 7b3 is required. There aren't any dependencies besides system frameworks.


## Installation

[Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage) is the recommended way to install Static. Add the following to your Cartfile:

``` ruby
github "venmo/Static"
```

You can also install with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org):

``` ruby
pod 'Static'
```

For manual installation, it's recommended to add the project as a subproject to your project or workspace and adding the appropriate framework as a target dependency.


## Usage

Enjoy.
